    <p>Python is literally eating the programming world. It is growing in popularity
and usage in ways that are pretty much unprecedented in the history of
computers.</p>
    <p>There is a huge variety of scenarios that Python excels in. Shell scripting,
task automation, Web development are just some basic examples.</p>
    <p>Python is the language of choice for data analysis and machine learning,
but it can also adapt to create games and work with embedded devices.</p>
    <p>Most importantly, it's the language of choice for introductory computer
science courses in universities all around the world.</p>
    <p>Many students learn Python as their first programming language. Many are
learning it right now, many will learn it in the future. And for many of them,
Python will be the only programming language they need.</p>
    <p>Thanks to this unique position, Python is likely going to grow even more in
the future.
The language is simple, expressive, and it's quite straightforward.
The ecosystem is huge. There seems to be a library for everything you can
imagine.
Python is a high-level programming language suitable for beginners thanks
to its intuitive syntax, its huge community and vibrant ecosystem.
It is also appreciated by professionals across many different fields.
Technically speaking it is an interpreted language that does not have an
intermediate compilation phase like a compiled language, for example C or
Java.</p>
    <p>And like many interpreted languages, it is dynamically typed, which means
that you do not have to indicate the types of the variables you use, and
variables are not tied to a specific type.6
This has pros and cons. In particular we can mention that you write
programs faster, but on the other hand you have less help from the tools to
prevent possible bugs and you will find out about some kinds of issues only
by executing the program at runtime.</p>
    <p>Python supports a wide variety of different programming paradigms,
including procedural programming, object oriented programming and
functional programming. It's flexible enough to adapt to a lot of different
needs.
        Starting with Python is very easy. All you need is to install the official
package from python.org, for Windows, macOS or Linux, and you're ready to
go.
        If you are new to programming, in the following posts I will guide you to go
from zero to becoming a Python programmer.</p>
    <p>And even if you are currently a programmer specialized into another
language, Python is a language worth knowing because I think we're just at
the start.</p>
    <p>Lower level languages like C++ and Rust might be great for expert
programmers, but daunting to begin, and they take a long time to master.
Python, on the other hand, is a programming language for programmers, of
course, but also for the non-programmers. The students, the people doing
their day job with Excel, the scientists.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="variables">
    <header>variables</header>
    <p>We can create a new Python variable by assigning a value to a label, using the <code> = </code>
assignment operator.</p>
    <p>In this example we assign a string with the value "Roger" to the name label:
        <code>
            name = "Roger"
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>Here's an example with a number:
        <code>
            age = 8
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>A variable name can be composed by characters, numbers, the _
underscore character. It can't start with a number. These are all valid
variable names:
<code>
name1
AGE
aGE
a11111
my_name
_name
</code>
</p>
    <p>These are invalid variable names:
        <code>
            123
            test!
            name%
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>Other than that, anything is valid unless it's a Python keyword. There are
some keywords like for , if , while , import and more.</p>
    <h2>Expressions and statement</h2>
    <p>
        We can expression any sort of code that returns a value. For example
        <code>
            1 + 1
            "Roger"
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>A statement on the other hand is an operation on a value, for example these
are 2 statements:
        <code>
            name = "Roger"
            print(name)
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>A program is formed by a series of statements. Each statement is put on its
own line, but you can use a semicolon to have more than one statement on a
single line:
        <code>
            name = "Roger"; print(name)
        </code>
</p>
    <h2>Comment</h2>
    <p>In a Python program, everything after a hash mark is ignored, and
considered a comment:
        <code>
            #this is a commented line
            name = "Roger" # this is an inline comment
        </code>
</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="data_types">
    <header>data_types</header>
    <p>Python has several built-in types.</p>
    <p>If you create the name variable assigning it the value "Roger", automatically
this variable is now representing a String data type.
        <code>
            name = "Roger"
        </code>
</p>
    <p>You can check which type a variable is using the type() function, passing
the variable as an argument, and then comparing the result to str :
        <code>
            name = "Roger"
            type(name) == str #True
        </code>
</p>
    <p>Or using isinstance() :
        <code>
            name = "Roger"
            isinstance(name, str) #True
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>Notice that to see the True value in Python, outside of a REPL, you
need to wrap this code inside print() , but for clarity reasons I avoid
using it</p>
    <p>We used the str class here, but the same works for other data types.
First, we have numbers. Integer numbers are represented using the int
class. Floating point numbers (fractions) are of type float :
        <code>
            age = 1
            type(age) == int #True
        </code>
        <code>
            fraction = 0.1
            type(fraction) == float #True
        </code>
    <p>You saw how to create a type from a value literal, like this:
        <code>
            name = "Flavio"
            age = 20
        </code>
    </p>
</p>
    <p>Python automatically detects the type from the value type.
You can also create a variable of a specific type by using the class constructor,
passing a value literal or a variable name:
        <code>
            name = str("Flavio")
            anotherName = str(name)
        </code>
</p>
    <p>You can also convert from one type to another by using the class constructor.
Python will try to determine the correct value, for example extracting a
number from a string:
        <code>
            age = int("20")
            print(age) #20
            fraction = 0.1
            intFraction = int(fraction)
            print(intFraction) #0
        </code>
</p>
    <p>This is called casting. Of course this conversion might not always work
depending on the value passed. If you write test instead of 20 in the
above string, you'll get a ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base
10: 'test' error.</p>
    <p>Those are just the basics of types. We have a lot more types in Python:
        <ul>
            <li><code>complex</code> for complex numbers</li>
            <li><code>bool</code> for booleans</li>
            <li><code>list</code> for lists</li>
            <li><code>tuple</code> for tuples</li>
            <li><code>range</code> for ranges</li>
            <li><code>dict</code> for dictionaries</li>
            <li><code>set</code> for sets</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="operators">
    <header>operators</header>
    <p>Python operators are symbols that we use to run operations upon values and
variables.
We can divide operators based on the kind of operation they perform:
        <ul>
            <li>assignment operator</li>
            <li>arithmetic operators</li>
            <li>comparison operators</li>
            <li>logical operators</li>
            <li>bitwise operators</li>
        </ul>
</p>
    <h2>Assignment operator</h2>
    <p>The assignment operator is used to assign a value to a variable:
        <code>
            age = 8
        </code>
    <p>Or to assign a variable value to another variable:
        <code>
            age = 8
            anotherVariable = age
        </code>
    </p>
    </p>
    <h2>Arithmetic operator</h2>
    <p>Python has a number of arithmetic operators: + , - , * , / (division), %
(remainder), ** (exponentiation) and // (floor division):
        <code>
            1 + 1 #2,
            2 - 1 #1,
            2 * 2 #4,
            4 / 2 #2,
            4 % 3 #1,
            4 ** 2 #16,
            4 // 2 #2
        </code>
</p>
    <h2>Comparison operator</h2>
    <p>Python defines a few comparison operators:
        <ul>
            <li>==</li>
            <li>!=</li>
            <li>&lt;</li>
            <li>&gt;</li>
            <li>>=</li>
            <li>&lt;=</li>
        </ul>
    <p>You can use those operators to get a boolean value ( True or False )
depending on the result:
        <code>
            a = 1,
            b = 2,
            a == b #False,
            a != b #True,
            a > b #False,
            a <= b #True
        </code>
</p>
    </p>
    <h2>Boolean operator</h2>
    <p>Python gives us the following boolean operators:
        <ul>
            <li>not</li>
            <li>and</li>
            <li>or</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>When working with True or False attributes, those work like logical AND,
OR and NOT, and are often used in the if conditional expression
evaluation:
        <code>
            condition1 = True,
            condition2 = False,
            not condition1 #False,
            condition1 and condition2 #False,
            condition1 or condition2 #True
        </code>
    <p><code>or</code> used in an expression returns the value of the first operand that is not a
falsy value ( False , 0 , '' , [] ..). Otherwise it returns the last operand.
        <code>
            print(0 or 1) ### 1,
            print(False or 'hey') ### 'hey',
            print('hi' or 'hey') ### 'hi',
            print([] or False) ### False,
            print(False or []) ### []
        </code>
    <p>The Python docs describe it as if x is false, then y, else x .
and only evaluates the second argument if the first one is true. So if the first
argument is falsy ( False , 0 , '' , [] ..), it returns that argument.
Otherwise it evaluates the second argument:
        <code>
            print(0 and 1) ### 0,
            print(1 and 0) ### 0,
            print(False and 'hey') ### False,
            print('hi' and 'hey') ### 'hey',
            print([] and False ) ### [],
            print(False and [] ) ### False,
        </code>
    <p>The Python docs describe it as if x is false, then x, else y .</p>
</p>
</p>
</p>
    <h2>Bitwise operator</h2>
    <p>Some operators are used to work on bits and binary numbers:
        <ul>
            <li><code> & </code>performs binary AND</li>
            <li><code> | </code>performs binary OR</li>
            <li><code> ^ </code>performs a binary XOR operation</li>
            <li><code> ~ </code>performs a binary NOT operation</li>
            <li><code> << </code>shift left operation</li>
            <li><code> >> </code>shift right operation</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3><code>is</code> and <code>in</code></h3>
    <p><code>is</code> is called the <b>identity operator</b>. It is used to compare two objects and
returns true if both are the same object. More on objects later.</p>
    <p><code>in</code> is called the <b>membership operator</b>. Is used to tell if a value is
contained in a list, or another sequence. More on lists and other sequences
later.</p>
    <h2>The Ternary Operator</h2>
    <p>The ternary operator in Python allows you to quickly define a conditional.
Let's say you have a function that compares an age variable to the 18
value, and return True or False depending on the result.
Instead of writing:
        <code>
            def is_adult(age):
            if age > 18:
            return True
            else:
            return False
        </code>
</p>
    <p>You can implement it with the ternary operator in this way:
        <code>
            def is_adult(age):
            return True if age > 18 else False
        </code>
    <p>First you define the result if the condition is True, then you evaluate the
condition, then you define the result if the condition is false:
        <code>
            <result_if_true> if <condition> else <result_if_false></result_if_false>
        </code>
</p>
    </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="functions">
    <header>functions</header>
    <p>A function lets us create a set of instructions that we can run when needed.
Functions are essential in Python and in many other programming languages
to create meaningful programs, because they allow us to decompose a
program into manageable parts, they promote readability and code reuse.
Here is an example function called hello that prints "Hello!":
        <code>
            def hello():
            print('Hello!')
        </code>
</p>
    <p>This is the function definition. There is a name ( hello ) and a body, the set
of instructions, which is the part that follows the colon and it's indented one
level on the right.
To run this function, we must call it. This is the syntax to call the function:
        <code>
            hello()
        </code>
</p>
    <p>We can execute this function once, or multiple times.
The name of the function, hello , is very important. It should be descriptive,
so anyone calling it can imagine what the function does.
        <code>
            def hello(name):
            print('Hello ' + name + '!')
        </code>
</p>
    <p>In this case we call the function passing the argument
        <code>
            hello('Roger')
        </code>
    <p>We call parameters the values accepted by the function inside the
function definition, and arguments the values we pass to the function
when we call it. It's common to get confused about this distinction.</p>
    </p>
    <p>An argument can have a default value that's applied if the argument is not
specified:
        <code>
            def hello(name='my friend'):
            print('Hello ' + name + '!')
            hello()
            #Hello my friend!
        </code>
    <p>Here's how we can accept multiple parameters:
        <code>
            def hello(name, age):
            print('Hello ' + name + ', you are ' + str(age) + ' years old!')
        </code>
    <p>In this case we call the function passing a set of arguments:
        <code>
            hello('Roger', 8)
        </code>
    </p>
    </p>
</p>
    <p>Parameters are passed by reference. All types in Python are objects but some
of them are immutable, including integers, booleans, floats, strings, and
tuples. This means that if you pass them as parameters and you modify their
value inside the function, the new value is not reflected outside of the
function:
        <code>
            def change(value):
            value = 2
            val = 1
            change(val)
            print(val) #1
        </code>
</p>
    <p>If you pass an object that's not immutable, and you change one of its
properties, the change will be reflected outside.
A function can return a value, using the return statement. For example in
this case we return the name parameter name:
        <code>
            def hello(name):
            print('Hello ' + name + '!')
            return name
        </code>
</p>
    <p>When the function meets the return statement, the function ends.
We can omit the value:
        <code>
            def hello(name):
            print('Hello ' + name + '!')
            return
        </code>
</p>
    <p>We can have the return statement inside a conditional, which is a common
way to end a function if a starting condition is not met:
        <code>
            def hello(name):
            if not name:
            return
            print('Hello ' + name + '!')
        </code>
</p>
    <p>If we call the function passing a value that evaluates to False , like an empty
string, the function is terminated before reaching the print() statement.
You can return multiple values by using comma separated values:
        <code>
            def hello(name):
            print('Hello ' + name + '!')
            return name, 'Roger', 8
        </code>
    <p>In this case calling hello('Syd') the return value is a tuple containing those
3 values: ('Syd', 'Roger', 8) .</p>
</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="classes">
    <header>classes</header>
    <p>In addition to using the Python-provided types, we can declare our own
classes, and from classes we can instantiate objects.
An object is an instance of a class. A class is the type of an object.</p>
    <p>Define a class in this way:
        <code>
            class <class_name>:
            # my class
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>For example let's define a Dog class
        <code>
            class Dog:
            # the Dog class
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>A class can define methods:
        <code>
            class Dog:
            # the Dog class
            def bark(self):
            print('WOF!')
        </code>
    <p><code>self</code> as the argument of the method points to the current object
instance, and must be specified when defining a method.</p>
    </p>
    <p>We create an instance of a class, an object, using this syntax:
        <code>
            roger = Dog()
        </code>
    <p>Now roger is a new object of type Dog.</p>
    </p>
    <p>If you run
        <code>
            print(type(roger))
        </code>
    <p>You will get class '__main__.Dog'</class></p>
    </p>
    <p>A special type of method, __init__() is called constructor, and we can use it
to initialize one or more properties when we create a new object from that
class:
        <code>
            class Dog:
            # the Dog class
            def __init__(self, name, age):
            self.name = name
            self.age = age
            def bark(self):
            print('WOF!')
        </code>
</p>
    <p>We use it in this way:
        <code>
            roger = Dog('Roger', 8)
            print(roger.name) # 'Roger'
            print(roger.age) # 8
            roger.bark() # 'WOF!'
        </code>
    <p>One important features of classes is inheritance.</p>
    </p>
    <p>We can create an Animal class with a method walk() :
        <code>
            class Animal:
            def walk(self):
            print('Walking..')
        </code>
    <p>and the Dog class can inherit from Animal:
        <code>
            class Dog(Animal):
            def bark(self):
            print('WOF!')
        </code>
    </p>
    </p>
    <p>Now creating a new object of class Dog will have the walk() method as
that's inherited from Animal :
        <code>
            roger = Dog()
            roger.walk() # 'Walking..'
            roger.bark() # 'WOF!'
        </code>
</p>
