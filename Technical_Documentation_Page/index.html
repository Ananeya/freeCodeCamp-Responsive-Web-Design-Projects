    <p>Python is literally eating the programming world. It is growing in popularity
and usage in ways that are pretty much unprecedented in the history of
computers.</p>
    <p>There is a huge variety of scenarios that Python excels in. Shell scripting,
task automation, Web development are just some basic examples.</p>
    <p>Python is the language of choice for data analysis and machine learning,
but it can also adapt to create games and work with embedded devices.</p>
    <p>Most importantly, it's the language of choice for introductory computer
science courses in universities all around the world.</p>
    <p>Many students learn Python as their first programming language. Many are
learning it right now, many will learn it in the future. And for many of them,
Python will be the only programming language they need.</p>
    <p>Thanks to this unique position, Python is likely going to grow even more in
the future.
The language is simple, expressive, and it's quite straightforward.
The ecosystem is huge. There seems to be a library for everything you can
imagine.
Python is a high-level programming language suitable for beginners thanks
to its intuitive syntax, its huge community and vibrant ecosystem.
It is also appreciated by professionals across many different fields.
Technically speaking it is an interpreted language that does not have an
intermediate compilation phase like a compiled language, for example C or
Java.</p>
    <p>And like many interpreted languages, it is dynamically typed, which means
that you do not have to indicate the types of the variables you use, and
variables are not tied to a specific type.6
This has pros and cons. In particular we can mention that you write
programs faster, but on the other hand you have less help from the tools to
prevent possible bugs and you will find out about some kinds of issues only
by executing the program at runtime.</p>
    <p>Python supports a wide variety of different programming paradigms,
including procedural programming, object oriented programming and
functional programming. It's flexible enough to adapt to a lot of different
needs.
        Starting with Python is very easy. All you need is to install the official
package from python.org, for Windows, macOS or Linux, and you're ready to
go.
        If you are new to programming, in the following posts I will guide you to go
from zero to becoming a Python programmer.</p>
    <p>And even if you are currently a programmer specialized into another
language, Python is a language worth knowing because I think we're just at
the start.</p>
    <p>Lower level languages like C++ and Rust might be great for expert
programmers, but daunting to begin, and they take a long time to master.
Python, on the other hand, is a programming language for programmers, of
course, but also for the non-programmers. The students, the people doing
their day job with Excel, the scientists.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="variables">
    <header>Variables</header>
    <p>We can create a new Python variable by assigning a value to a label, using the <code> = </code>
assignment operator.</p>
    <p>In this example we assign a string with the value "Roger" to the name label:
        <code>
            name = "Roger"
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>Here's an example with a number:
        <code>
            age = 8
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>A variable name can be composed by characters, numbers, the _
underscore character. It can't start with a number. These are all valid
variable names:
<code>
name1
AGE
aGE
a11111
my_name
_name
</code>
</p>
    <p>These are invalid variable names:
        <code>
            123
            test!
            name%
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>Other than that, anything is valid unless it's a Python keyword. There are
some keywords like for , if , while , import and more.</p>
    <h2>Expressions and statement</h2>
    <p>
        We can expression any sort of code that returns a value. For example
        <code>
            1 + 1
            "Roger"
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>A statement on the other hand is an operation on a value, for example these
are 2 statements:
        <code>
            name = "Roger"
            print(name)
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>A program is formed by a series of statements. Each statement is put on its
own line, but you can use a semicolon to have more than one statement on a
single line:
        <code>
            name = "Roger"; print(name)
        </code>
</p>
    <h2>Comment</h2>
    <p>In a Python program, everything after a hash mark is ignored, and
considered a comment:
        <code>
            #this is a commented line
            name = "Roger" # this is an inline comment
        </code>
</p>
    <!-- <code>1</code>
    <code>2</code>
    <code>3</code>
    <code>4</code>
    <code>5</code> -->
    <!-- <ol>
        <li>5</li>
        <li>4</li>
        <li>3</li>
        <li>2</li>
        <li>1</li>
    </ol> -->
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="data-types">
    <header>Data Types</header>
    <p>Python has several built-in types.</p>
    <p>If you create the name variable assigning it the value "Roger", automatically
this variable is now representing a String data type.
        <code>
            name = "Roger"
        </code>
</p>
    <p>You can check which type a variable is using the type() function, passing
the variable as an argument, and then comparing the result to str :
        <code>
            name = "Roger"
            type(name) == str #True
        </code>
</p>
    <p>Or using isinstance() :
        <code>
            name = "Roger"
            isinstance(name, str) #True
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>Notice that to see the True value in Python, outside of a REPL, you
need to wrap this code inside print() , but for clarity reasons I avoid
using it</p>
    <p>We used the str class here, but the same works for other data types.
First, we have numbers. Integer numbers are represented using the int
class. Floating point numbers (fractions) are of type float :
        <code>
            age = 1
            type(age) == int #True
        </code>
        <code>
            fraction = 0.1
            type(fraction) == float #True
        </code>
    <p>You saw how to create a type from a value literal, like this:
        <code>
            name = "Flavio"
            age = 20
        </code>
    </p>
</p>
    <p>Python automatically detects the type from the value type.
You can also create a variable of a specific type by using the class constructor,
passing a value literal or a variable name:
        <code>
            name = str("Flavio")
            anotherName = str(name)
        </code>
</p>
    <p>You can also convert from one type to another by using the class constructor.
Python will try to determine the correct value, for example extracting a
number from a string:
        <code>
            age = int("20")
            print(age) #20
            fraction = 0.1
            intFraction = int(fraction)
            print(intFraction) #0
        </code>
</p>
    <p>This is called casting. Of course this conversion might not always work
depending on the value passed. If you write test instead of 20 in the
above string, you'll get a ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base
10: 'test' error.</p>
    <p>Those are just the basics of types. We have a lot more types in Python:
        <ul>
            <li><code>complex</code> for complex numbers</li>
            <li><code>bool</code> for booleans</li>
            <li><code>list</code> for lists</li>
            <li><code>tuple</code> for tuples</li>
            <li><code>range</code> for ranges</li>
            <li><code>dict</code> for dictionaries</li>
            <li><code>set</code> for sets</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
